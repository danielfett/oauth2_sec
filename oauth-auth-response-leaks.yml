title: OAuth 2.0 Authorization (Authz Response Leaks)
desc: >-
  This is an analysis of various OAuth flows under the assumption that
  <b>the authorization response leaks</b> and no other attacks are
  performed on the OAuth flows (e.g., endpoints are configured
  correctly and do not act maliciously, etc.).

      If an authorization code leaks from the authz response, and is
      not protected by PKCE or the id token nonce, then the flow must
      be insecure. The attacker can circumvent client authentication
      as follows: He starts a new OAuth flow with the same client that
      the user used and injects the stolen code into the authorization
      response before it is sent to the client. The client will then
      use its client credentials to authenticate at the token
      endpoint.

  - desc: If an authorization code leaks from the authz response, and is not protected by PKCE or the id token nonce, then the flow must be insecure. Without client authentication, the attacker can use the stolen code at the token endpoint and exchange it for an access token that gives access to the user's resources. (The attacker can spoof the client id.)

  - desc: If PKCE or nonce are used, a code in the authorization response can leak, but the response will still be secure.
    if: code_in_authz_response  and (pkce or nonce)
    secprop: authz
    
  - desc: If a token leaks from the authorization response, an attacker can immediately use this token at the resource server, which break authorization.
